Hopper mod

based on jordan4ibanez original mod
optimized by TenPlus1

Hoppers allow for items dropped on top to be sucked in and transfered to chests/hoppers below and beside the original hopper.  Chests above hopper will have items inside transfered into hopper.  Furnaces above hopper will have output transfered into hopper, furnaces below will have hopper items dropped into source material to be cooked and furnaces to the side will have hopper items copied into fuel slot.
